# PicShareapp
A web application that showcases a wide variety of pictures, photos and illustrations that others have created. Socialize with other people who like the same kind of pictures that you do and keep track of the work of your favorite artists!

## Tools
The application uses a front-end that utilizes CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript. The application also uses a Java backend that communicates with a Java Database (Although because this is mostly a 'showcase' app it gets its data from a hardcoded ServiceProvider for now). The front-end communicates with the backend through REST calls.
